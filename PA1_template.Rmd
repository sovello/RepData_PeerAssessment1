# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
We first read the data into a variable
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, na.strings="NA")
```

After this we need to make sure the date variable is of class Date
```{r, echo=TRUE}
if( class(activity$date) != 'Date'){
  activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)  
}
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
